To run this Snake game on your local machine, you will need to have Python installed, as well as the Pygame library. You can check if you have Python installed by running the following command in your terminal:
##
``
python --version
``
##
If Python is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/
Once you have Python installed, you can install Pygame by running the following command in your terminal:
##
``
pip install pygame
``
##
After Pygame has been installed, you can run the Snake game by saving the code to a file (e.g. "snake.py") and running the following command in your terminal:
##
``
python snake.py
``
##
This will run the game and open a window where you can play the game. You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake. Good luck!
